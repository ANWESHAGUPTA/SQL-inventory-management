# Coffeehouse Inventory Management and Customer Engagement System

## Overview

Welcome to the repository showcasing the **Coffeehouse Inventory Management and Customer Engagement System**. This project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) using SQL. The primary goal is to rationalize inventory management for an upcoming chain of coffeehouses while also facilitating targeted advertisement delivery to loyal customers through a third-party SMS gateway.

## Project Highlights

- **Efficient Inventory Management**: The DBMS streamlines inventory tracking and management across multiple coffeehouse locations, ensuring optimal stock levels and reducing wastage.

- **Customer Engagement**: By integrating with a third-party SMS gateway, the system enables personalized advertisements to be sent to loyal customers, enhancing customer engagement and retention.

- **Seamless Data Integrity**: The use of SQL ensures data integrity, accuracy, and consistency in inventory records and customer interactions.

## Key Components and Features

1. **Inventory Management**:
   - Real-time inventory tracking of coffeehouse supplies, including coffee beans, milk, pastries, and other items.
   - Automated alerts for low stock items, ensuring timely replenishment and minimizing out-of-stock situations.

2. **Customer Engagement**:
   - Customer profile management, recording purchase history and preferences.
   - Integration with a third-party SMS gateway to deliver targeted advertisements, promotions, and special offers to loyal customers.

3. **Database Design**:
   - Well-structured relational database schema for efficient data storage and retrieval.
   - Implementation of normalized tables to minimize data redundancy and maintain data integrity.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Detailed discussions with coffeehouse management to understand inventory needs and customer engagement goals.

2. **Database Design**: Designing the relational database schema to accommodate inventory details, customer profiles, and transaction records.

3. **SQL Implementation**: Writing SQL queries and scripts to create and populate the database, incorporating CRUD operations for inventory and customer data.

4. **Integration with SMS Gateway**: Implementing APIs to connect with the third-party SMS gateway for advertisement delivery.

## Usage and Interactivity

To understand the design and functionality of the Coffeehouse Inventory Management and Customer Engagement System, run the .sql files on your local machine and explore the interactive features.

Feel free to interact with the inventory management system, simulate customer profiles, and observe the seamless integration with the SMS gateway.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to:

- Implement user authentication and role-based access control for secure system usage.

- Enhance the customer engagement system by incorporating data analytics for more targeted advertisements.
